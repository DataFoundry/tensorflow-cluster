contents below are the steps of creating a tensorflow cluster:

1. use k8s_tf.yaml to create a tensorflow cluster. After k8s_tf.yaml is executed 2 parameter servers and 3 workers will be appeared in openshift.
 oc create -f k8s_tf.yaml

2. use k8s_tf_tensorboard.yaml to create a tensorflowboard, and login to the router  of tf_tensorboard that generated by oc expose svc tf-runner-board to visit the tensorboard
oc create -f tf_tensorboard.yaml
oc expose svc tf-runner-board

3. use runner_jupyter.yml to create a jupyterboard, and login to the router of jupyterboard that generated by oc expose svc tf-runner-jupyter to visit the jupyterboard
oc create -f runner_jupyter.yml
oc expose svc tf-runner-jupyter

4. use runner_fileserver.yml to create a fileserverboard, which can be used to view and download files of tensorflow container
oc create -f runner_fileserver.yml

contents below are how to use tensorflow cluter:

there are some examples in tensorflow and we can use the examples to try tensowflow.
1. oc rsh tf-runner-jupyter-643y7(this is pod name)

2. cd /distributed and the cotent below should be seen:

3. ./start_tf.sh 2 2 mnist_cnn.py
The first parameter gives the number of workers. This can be equal or smaller than the nubmer of workers specified when creating the cluster).
The second parameter gives the number of parameter servers. This must be the same as the number specified when creating the TensorFlow cluster.
The third parameter gives the code to be run.

the process and result should like this:

4. during this process, the logs are saved in /tmp/dist-mnist-log by default, we need to mkdir /log and cp -r /tmp/dist-mnist-log /log, which 
ensures that the tensorboard can show the result

5. login to the router  of tf_tensorboard to check the result
